# Overview

This project uses historical Census data to find the peak population year of every county in the US between 1920 and 2020. It is summarized in a blog post on my website [here](https://aaroneolson.com/2024/08/09/when-did-each-county-s-population-peak/).

If you want to view the full R code for the project, that can be found in the R Notebook file [here](https://github.com/marginofaaron/county-max-population-years/blob/main/my_notebook.Rmd). A fully-rendered HTML version can be downloaded and opened in a browser [here](https://github.com/marginofaaron/county-max-population-years/blob/main/my_notebook.html).

# Description

An exploration of when population peaked in each county in the U.S. between 1920 and 2020.

Keep in mind that some county borders may have changed during this time period, so it's possible that some change in population is due to border change rather than change in the number of people within the same boundaries.

1920 was selected as a start year for two reasons. First, this allows us to view population change over the last century. Second, Most significant county border changes had been completed by 1920.

For more about how borders have changed over time, check out the [Atlas of County Historical Boundaries](https://digital.newberry.org/ahcb/index.html). Data was retrieved through the [National Historical Geographic Information System](https://www.nhgis.org/).
